title: Hello, World!
---

Hi everyone!

Some time ago I finally decided to create my own personal blog.

There are several reasons for starting it:

* I want to have a personal page with the short story about me
* Sometimes I accumulate something to share with the world
* Practice in writing, especially in English writing 

Now don't know actually what I will write about, but I think it will be about web development, technologies, useful tools
 and of course about my trips and hobbies.

This blog is rendered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), based on [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com/) theme and hosted by Github Pages.
Sources live on this [repository]({{ site.repository }}), so if you find any typo you can easily fork this repository and edit.

Highly inspired by [William Durand's blog](http://williamdurand.fr/).

Let the blog begin!
